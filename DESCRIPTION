Package: snapfire
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Title: API to SNAP Wildfire Data Collections
Description: Provides access to curated collections of public wildfire data sets
    offered by Scenarios Network for Alaska and Arctic Planning (SNAP) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
    'snapfire' interfaces with SNAP's Amazon Web Services cloud storage to retrieve specific fire data.
    Available data includes historical observational fire data and historical and projected climate model-driven fire simulation outputs.
    Available fire variables include fire frequency, fire size and total burn area.
    Auxiliary variables include modeled vegetation cover area and stand age, which are also part of SNAP fire simulation outputs.
    Simulations driven by climate model inputs are done using SNAP's ALFRESCO wildfire and landscape transition model.
    Spatial coverage includes politically and ecologically defined aerial units as well as communities and other 
    point locations of interest across Alaska and western Canada.
    Temporal resolutions include annual statistics and their decadal averages.
